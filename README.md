CS378, Spring 2020 Homework 4, Question 1

The ciphertext (you can download the file vig2.txt from canvas) was generated using the Vigenere method with a key of length at most 6. Decrypt it. 

To this end build a suite of programs for breaking the Vigenere cipher. Describe all the steps of the process and how the results guided you towards the key. Comment on what is unusual about the plaintext. How did it affect the results? Arrange your the description of the process, all partial results and you comments as a single pdf file.

Submit your program (the source code and brief instructions how to compile and run it). Submit a brief report with the results and a discussion interpreting them.
